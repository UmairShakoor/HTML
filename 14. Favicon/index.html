           <h1>Favicon - About</h1>
             <p>A favicon (favorite icon) is a tiny icon included along with a website, which is displayed in places like the browser's address bar, page tabs and bookmarks menu.
            Note, however, that most modern browsers replaced the favicon from the address bar by an image indicating whether or not the website is using HTTPS. </p>
           <h2>Important Explanation about favicon</h2>
             <p>
         We can link an img as a favicon in many formats like gif,png,ico,svg,jpeg etc.
    <strong>.ico > .png > .svg</strong>
    The above order means that .ico is considered a best practice when using as favicon bcz it is widely supported by almost all browsers as a favicon (while writing code use .png bcz some code editors don't support .ico file to be opened)and the remaining two formats are supported by browsers as of order .png > .svg ...
    Don't Stuck to this order, You can also use png(Portable Network Graphic) for favicon according to your convenient..
             </p>
             <p><strong>Note:</strong>
    Favicon is shown is browser by a default dimension of 16*16px but don't use the 16*16px dimensions while creating a favicon or using it as a favicon bcz favicon is not just used in browsers tab but also used as shortcut icon by google.. . Instead, Consider that your favicon must be a multiple of 48px square as : 48*48 px , 96*96 px , 144*144 px and so on.. When you use svg as favicon so, don't worry about it's dimensions</p>
