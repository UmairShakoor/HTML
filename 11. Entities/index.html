    Entities
  </h3>
  <!-- we use entities in html to show specific characters like copyright, less than, greater than, etc, which are ignored or 
hidden by html but we can show them in html by using entities as follows: -->
  <p>
    for showing tags (less than or greater than)
    we use entity ex. &lt;p &gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    for showing copyright symbol
    we use entity ex. &copy;
  </p>
  <p>
      <!-- HTML ignores extra space (more than one) So, -->
    for use of extra spaces between the text instead jumping new line we use entity &nbsp; ex.
  </p>
  <p>
    for empty text we use entity: 
    <pre> <!-- pre tag is used to write text as it is  -->
        
        '&#8203;'
        
    </pre>
  </p>
  <hr>
  we can use different entities whose resources are avail on Google
